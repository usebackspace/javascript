<!--  for loop

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}


Initialization:This part is executed once before the loop starts. It typically initializes a loop control variable.

Condition: The loop will continue executing as long as this condition is `true`. When the condition becomes `false`, the loop terminates.

Increment/Decrement: After each iteration, this part is executed to modify the loop control variable, usually to move closer to the termination condition.

Here's an example of a `for` loop that counts from 1 to 5:
